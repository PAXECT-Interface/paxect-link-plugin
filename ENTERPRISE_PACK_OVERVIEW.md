# PAXECT Link â€” Enterprise Pack Overview

Welcome!  
This document outlines the **Enterprise Pack vision** for the PAXECT Link Plugin.  
It defines what remains open-source and what may become part of future enterprise-grade extensions.

---

## Scope

The **open-source edition** will always remain free under the **Apache-2.0 license** and includes:

- PAXECT Core (deterministic runtime)
- PAXECT Link Plugin (secure inbox/outbox bridge)
- AEAD Hybrid Plugin (encryption and integrity)
- Polyglot Plugin (cross-language data bridge)
- SelfTune Plugin (adaptive runtime control)
- Demo suite (01â€“06)
- Deterministic CI/CD smoke & recovery scripts

The **Enterprise Pack** extends Link with optional capabilities for regulated environments and large-scale systems.

---

## Vision

The Enterprise Pack focuses on **high-assurance operations** and **integrations** rather than new logic.  
Its goal is to extend, not replace, the open-source version.

It provides:

- Advanced **security & trust** modules (Vault / HSM / KMS support)
- **Policy federation** for multi-site deterministic pipelines
- **Compliance connectors** (ISO, NIST, EU NIS2 mapping)
- **Monitoring integrations** (Prometheus, Grafana, Splunk)
- **Deployment templates** (systemd, Docker, Helm)
- **Extended audit trails** and reproducibility validation
- Optional **enterprise-grade support** through verified partners

---

## Community & Ownership

- The PAXECT **Core and Link** remain open-source and free to use.  
- The **Enterprise Pack** stays proprietary and maintained by the project Owner.  
- Verified partners may co-develop enterprise extensions under contributor license agreements.  
- No vendor lock-in â€” you can always use the open-source Core + Link independently.

---

## Participation

At this stage:
- We **do not sell or distribute** enterprise packages yet.  
- We **welcome volunteers, integrators, and security partners** to help define or test extensions.

## Key Principles

> **Open Core. Verified Extensions. Zero Telemetry.**

The objective is a trustworthy, deterministic bridge suitable for both open-source users and enterprise systems â€”  
guaranteeing **bit-identical data**, **policy consistency**, and **offline reproducibility** across all environments.
