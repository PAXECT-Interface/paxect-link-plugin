- Do **not** create public issues or pull requests for unresolved vulnerabilities.

## Disclosure Process

1. Reports are acknowledged within **72 hours**.  
2. A maintainer will contact you for details and a reproduction (if needed).  
3. A fix or mitigation will be prepared privately.  
4. Once resolved, a public advisory and changelog entry will be published.  
5. Researchers are credited (if they wish) after coordinated disclosure.
